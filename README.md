# heatX Project

## Introduction
**heatX** is a device designed to improve 3D print quality by drying filament and maintaining an optimal filament temperature. This ensures consistent and reliable printing performance, especially when working with moisture-sensitive filaments.

## Features
- **Filament Drying:** Removes moisture to prevent print defects.
- **Temperature Regulation:** Maintains optimal filament temperature for better flow and adhesion.
- **Improved 3D Print Quality:** Ensures consistent results, even with challenging materials.

## Documentation
